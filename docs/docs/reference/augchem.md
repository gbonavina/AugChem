# What is Augchem?

Augchem is a comprehensive toolbox for chemical data augmentation developed in partnership with CINE and FAPESP. It provides state-of-the-art techniques for augmenting molecular data across multiple representations.

## Why use data augmentation for chemical data?

Machine Learning (ML) is gaining prominence in the discovery of new materials, complementing traditional methods by analyzing large volumes of data and identifying patterns. The effectiveness of ML models depends on data quality, making data augmentation techniques essential to improve model accuracy in materials chemistry. However, there is a lack of studies integrating these techniques in this field. This toolbox aims to address this gap with easy-to-use Python libraries for chemical data augmentation.
